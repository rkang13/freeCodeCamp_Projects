# freeCodeCamp_Projects
This repository contains the practice projects that I made while I was performing my mandatory service.
The codes are replicas of the sample project that are on freeCodeCamp.
I plan to modify these templates for my personal usage and not use the exact copy of the freeCodeCamp sample project codes.
