# freeCodeCamp_Projects
This repository contains the practice projects that I worked on to develop my HTML and CSS skills.
The codes are sample project replicas from freeCodeCamp.
I plan to modify these templates for my personal usage and not use the exact copy of the freeCodeCamp sample project codes.
